This is an experimental format, so before we get started I should explain how it works.

You can see where you are in the bottom-right corner of the screen, and your page is auto-saved in the background, so you won&rsquo;t lose your place.

In my opinion, the best way to read this is on your phone. You can view in fullscreen (like an app) if you add it to your homescreen. But it&rsquo;s up to you.

Alright, let&rsquo;s go!

<span style="color:white; font-size: 1.25em;">You don&rsquo;t often hear startup folks talking about Michael Porter.</span>
<div class="pg-porter-photo"></div>

If you ask me, it&rsquo;s a damn shame!

Back in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, Porter <em>dominated</em> the world of business strategy. From his classroom at Harvard Business School, he launched a revolution.
<img src="./hbs-classroom.jpg" class="pg-bottom-img">

---
Porter's specialty was inventing&mdash;or, perhaps, discovering&mdash;elegant frameworks that could explain the success and failure of businesses across any era, industry, or geography.

Compared to the simple catch-phrases of the day&rsquo;s  management gurus, it truly was a paradigm shift.

---
Then something funny happened: <em>He became a victim of his own success.</em>

Then something funny happened: <em>He became a victim of his own success.</em>

There was no big scandal, or discrediting of his work. Just a slow forgetting. It&rsquo;s gotten to the point now where if you ask someone in startups if they've heard of Michael Porter, the only people that say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; have an MBA.

The reason why is an interesting story.

---
Before Porter was a professor at HBS, he earned a PhD in Economics.

The two fields overlap in theory, but their cultures couldn't be more different. Economists look for quantitative models that ignore the messiness of reality in order to capture the underlying truth, while managers value practical tools to help them deal with the mess.

<div class="pg-bg" style="background:black;"></div><div class="pg-physics-container">Porter always strived to unite these divergent approaches:

<blockquote class="pg-physics">My frameworks provide a set of logical relationships that are really fundamental. They&rsquo;re like physics. [...] These frameworks provide basic, fundamental, and I believe unchangeable relationships about the &lsquo;matter&rsquo; of competition.</blockquote>
&mdash; Michael Porter</div>

You get what you aim for, and Porter always chose precision over popularity. He wanted to construct a system of thought that would reflect the objective truth about business &mdash; even if it didn't offer simple, satisfying advice.

His books are demanding, detailed, and thick. They&rsquo;re the kind that everyone wants to read, but few people actually enjoy reading.

---
As a result, a whole new generation of entrepreneurs (the generation I belong to) has barely even heard of him. Even so, his ideas are as relevant now as ever, and provide crucial structures that can help anyone answer the question at the heart of our industry:

<h3>How I discovered Porter</h3>My first exposure to Porter probably came from my dad, who was a business school professor when I was growing up. But to be honest, I was not always interested in business.

It was the early 2000&rsquo;s, Bush was president, and I thought corporate life was boring at best, possibly even immoral. My goals at the time were to start a band and study philosophy.

In college, all this changed for me.

---
I began to see business &mdash; startups, really &mdash; as the best way to create new things that could make people&rsquo;s lives better. The question Porter spent his life working on gradually started to matter to me.

Even so, it took years for me to discover his work.

---
I was hooked on pop-song business advice: short, catchy, and easy to relate to. I clung to vivid metaphors like the &ldquo;Purple Cow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blue Ocean&rdquo;. I was a disciple of the Lean Startup. I practiced Design Thinking.

I devoured blog posts, Quora answers, and anything else that could ease my nagging fear that <em>I didn't know how things worked</em>, and thus <em>I might never create anything meaningful</em>.

---
As the years went on, I built and launched several products, and tasted my fair share of both success and failure. I started to realize that catchy stories, emotionally satisfying as they might be, were ultimately empty. I developed a taste for a more fundamental understanding of business, even if it offered no easy answers or memorable slogans.

Eventaully this search led me back to Porter. In his writings, I found what I was looking for. So let&rsquo;s dive in :)

<center><h2 style="font-size: 2em; line-height: 1.2em; padding-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">2. What is Strategy?</h2><em>(Hint: it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;operational effectiveness&rdquo;)</em></center>

---
Before Porter, most companies believed that the key to profitability was simply to do a better job than their competitors. This meant adhering to &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, hiring better employees, acquiring customers more cheaply, designing a better product, and so on.

Boston Consulting Group &mdash; the main strategy consulting firm at the time &mdash; created a name for this: the <em>experience curve</em>.

---
<h4>The Experience Curve says:</h4><p style="font-size: 1.25rem">&ldquo;As a business grows and gains experience, the average cost of serving each incremental customer goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- TODO insert an interactive graph or visualization of this phenomenon -->

---
Implicit in the concept of the experience curve is a strategy: win market share (a.k.a. be the biggest).

If you&rsquo;re bigger than your competitors, you will have lower unit costs, and therefore higher profits. Simple, right?

---
Porter&rsquo;s genius was to look beyond the experience curve and realize that beneath it, there is a deeper issue that sets the ultimate limit on any business&rsquo;s profitability, no matter how well they&rsquo;re executing and how big they get.

To understand what Porter saw, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what is really going on inside a business.

---
A business is a system that performs a set of activities to create a product and sell it to customers. We call a business &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; when the cost of performing the activities is less than the value it takes in from customers.

The underlying assumption in the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; is that the main way to grow your profits is to shrink your costs. That&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth.

---
The most interesting (and profitable) businesses don&rsquo;t just perform the same activities more cheaply than their competitors - they perform an entirely <em>different</em> set of activities.

Let&rsquo;s see how this works in practice, using one of Porter&rsquo;s favorite examples...

<img src="Ikea_logo.svg" style="width: 100%">

Before Ikea, most furniture stores were located inside cities and towns. When you walk in, a salesperson greets you and walks you through the medium-sized store, helping you make a buying decision. The selection was limited, but there were catalogs and extensive customization options. Unless it was a high-end designer store, the furniture had a standard look.
<img src="./furniture.jpg" class="pg-bottom-img">

---
If you owned one of these stores and followed the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; philosophy, you&rsquo;d probably focus on reducing your costs. You might try to negotiate better deals from your furniture suppliers, lower your rent, and keep wages low. You&rsquo;d also try to bring in new customers TV and newspaper advertising, and draw new customers in by having sales events and cutting prices. If it worked, you&rsquo;d be able to open up new locations and build brand awareness.

In short, you&rsquo;d try to do the same thing as everyone else - just a little bit better.

---
Obviously that&rsquo;s not what Ikea chose to do, and now they are the largest furniture retailer in the world.

They started by focusing on a very specific type of customer that they felt were underserved by the existing furniture retailers: price-conscious buyers that also care about design. Then they designed a system of activities tailored to this segment&rsquo;s unique needs, and ruthlessly throwing away much of the conventional industry wisdom.

Let&rsquo;s break down their choices.

---
Instead of relying on salespeople and catalogs to help you decide what to buy, Ikea&rsquo;s entire selection is on display in every store, accompanied by clear signage and informative catalogs. In case you need one, there are a few salespeople in every section, but their assistance is by no means necessary.

---
Instead of requiring an expensive shipping fee from the store to your house, every Ikea store comes with its own warehouse. Each item is flat-packed into boxes that you load and take home yourself. Ikea has chosen to do this because they know that their customers would rather do it themselves than pay to have them do it instead.

---
<div class="pg-bg" style="background-color: #C4E8FF;"></div>Instead of buying small retail locations inside cities and towns, they realized that furniture-buying is a rare event, that people are willing to make a trip. So they chose to construct giant stores on cheap land outside major metropolitan areas.

Because it&rsquo;s such a trip, and their stores are so isolated, they decided to install a restaurant and daycare center inside their store for parents with young children.
<img src="./ikea-store.jpg" class="pg-bottom-img">

---
These are just a few examples from the enormous set of unique features of the Ikea experience. As you can see, their success hasn&rsquo;t come from doing what everyone else does, but better. It stems from the fact that they chose <em>different</em> things to do.
